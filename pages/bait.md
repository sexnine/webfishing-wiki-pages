title: Bait

Bait is a consumable that can be bought from the [Bait and Sell Depot](/pages/bait-sell-depot).

Different kinds of bait can be unlocked from the [Fishing Store](/pages/shops/fishing-store).

The bait you use when fishing determines what tier and what quality of fish you can catch.  Higher quality bait will cost more money to restock.
